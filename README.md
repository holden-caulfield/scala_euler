Project Euler on Scala - Functional Style!

SPOILER ALERT
=============

This project is meant to be an interesting experiment on Scala's functional/mathematical capabilities. It is not meant to disclose or spoil the solutions to project euler. If you are interested on the problems themselves, it would be better for you to do the problems on your own first and in any case check the solutions on this repo afterwards. Otherwise it would ruin all the fun for you.
